hi
There are times when studies can really be frustrating,
One of the most important secrets in learning is: falling in love with the process, which is why I curated this "thread"
below thes file You will find a collection of mandalas and shapes, that I made and collected in Python, during my studies. 
Feel free to copy the document you want to see to your Text Editor or IDLE.
I would like to dedicate this project to the soul of Lucy Dee and her daughters(Three women from my community who were murdered in a terror attack)
May we all have a calm and quiet summer and find the dream job we were aiming for
